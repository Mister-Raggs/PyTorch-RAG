It is only intended as a safety mechanism for facilitating\nmass rollouts of numa binding.\n1. Applies NUMA binding to the current thread, suitable for the thread\nwhich will be interacting with GPU gpu_index.\n2. Resets to the original CPU affinity before exiting the context manager.\nIterator[None]",
