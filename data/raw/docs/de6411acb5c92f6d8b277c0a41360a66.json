  "text": "\n## PyTorch Governance | Mechanics#\n\nCreated On: Mar 11, 2019 | Last Updated On: Apr 16, 2025\n\n## Summary#\n\nPyTorch adopts a technical governance structure that is hierarchical.\nA community ofcontributorswho file issues, make pull requests,\nand contribute to the project.\nA small set ofmodule maintainersdrive each module of the PyTorch\nproject.\nThey are overseen bycore maintainers, who drive the\noverall project direction.\nThe core maintainers have alead core maintainerwho is the catch-all decision maker.\nAll maintainers are expected to have a strong bias towards\nPyTorch\u2019s design philosophy.\nBeyond the maintainers, the community is encouraged to contribute,\nfile issues, make proposals, review pull requests and be present\nin the community. Given contributions and willingness to invest,\nanyone can be accepted as a maintainer and provided write access\nor ownership of parts of the codebase.\nTechnical governance is strictly separated from business governance.\nSeparating technical from business governance ensures that there is\nno way for any person or company to \u201cbuy their way into\u201d the\ntechnical guidance of the project. Additionally, membership in\nthe technical governance process is forindividuals, not companies.\nThat is, there are no seats reserved for specific companies, and\nmembership is associated with the person rather than the company\nemploying that person.\n\n## Module Maintainers#\n\nModules are defined as GitHub repositories within the PyTorch org,\nor as directories within the core repositorypytorch/pytorch.\nEach module will have its own maintainer group. Maintainer\ngroups are responsible for reviewing and approving commits,\nimproving design, and changing the scope of the module.\nEach maintainer group may adopt its own rules and procedures\nfor making decisions (majority vote being default). Module\nmaintainers have the right to dispute decisions made by other\nmodule maintainers \u2013 especially if it affects them. When\ndisputes are made, the module maintainer group should\nprovide a reasonable and public explanation of the dispute,\nthe relevant arguments, and the resolution. In the exceptional\ncases where module maintainers cannot come to a conclusion\nthemselves, they will escalate to core maintainers for review.\nThe escalations are resolved by the core maintainers in\naccordance with their rules and procedures.\nEach maintainer group should publish publicly available\ncommunication for their module (a vision, rough roadmap,\ndesign docs, any disputes and dispute resolutions) so that\ncontributors and other interested parties understand the\nfuture direction of the project and can participate in discussion.\nResponsibilities of the maintainer includes:\nTriaging high priority issues of the module\nTriaging and reviewing and landing high priority pull requests of the module\nSupporting public documentation related to the module\nRunning public developer meetings\n\n## Core Maintainers#\n\nThe core maintainers are expected to have a deep understanding\nof the PyTorch code base and design philosophies. Their responsibilities\ninclude:\nArticulating a cohesive long-term vision for the project\nNegotiating and resolving contentious issues in ways\nacceptable to all parties involved\nReceiving broad requests for changes from stakeholders of\nPyTorch and evaluating / accepting them (small module-level\nrequests are handled by module maintainers)\nThe core maintainers as a group have the power to veto any\ndecision made at a Module maintainer level. The core\nmaintainers have power to resolve disputes as they see fit.\nThe core maintainers should publicly articulate their\ndecision-making, and give a clear reasoning for their\ndecisions, vetoes and dispute resolution.\nThe core maintainers are admins of the PyTorch GitHub Org\nand are listed inMaintainers.\n\n## Lead Core Maintainer (BDFL)#\n\nThere may be decisions in which the core maintainers cannot\ncome to a consensus. To make such difficult decisions, the\ncore maintainers have an assigned and publicly declared Lead\nCore Maintainer amongst them, also commonly known in open-source\ngovernance models as a BDFL.\nThe Lead Core Maintainer should publicly articulate their\ndecision-making, and give a clear reasoning for their\ndecisions. The Lead Core Maintainer is also responsible for\nconfirming or removing core maintainers.\n\n## Nominating, Confirming and Removing Maintainers#\n\n\n## The Principles#\n\nMembership in module maintainer groups is given toindividualsonmerit basisafter they demonstrated strong expertise of the\ncomponent through contributions, reviews and discussions and are\naligned with how the component fits in overall PyTorch direction.\nFor membership in the maintainer group the individual has to\ndemonstrate strong and continued alignment with the overall\nPyTorch principles.\nNo term limits for module maintainers or core maintainers\nLight criteria of moving module maintenance to \u2018emeritus\u2019\nstatus if they don\u2019t actively participate over long periods\nof time. Each module maintainer group may define the inactive\nperiod that\u2019s appropriate for that module.\nThe membership is for an individual, not a company.\n\n## The Process for Nomination#\n\nEach module has its own process. Please contact module maintainers for more information.\nHowever, if there is no process identified, you can file a request to the core\nmaintainers by submittingthis form.\nCore maintainers are meeting every three months.\nIf you are submitting a request to the core maintainers, the information in your request\nmust include the following items:\nThe nominees depth and breadth of code, review and design\ncontributions on the module\nTestimonials (positive and negative) of the nominee\u2019s interactions\nwith the maintainers, users, and the community\nGeneral testimonials of support from the maintainers\nThe core maintainers then evaluate all information and make\na final decision to Confirm or Decline the nomination. The\ndecision of the core maintainers has to be articulated well\nand would be public.\n\n## The Process for Removal#\n\nSimilar to the process for nomination, anyone in the community\ncan nominate a person to be removed from a Module maintainer\nposition or a Core maintainer position.\nA person can also self-nominate to be removed\nThe core maintainers (excluding persons with conflict of\ninterest) will request or put together more information around\nthe following:\nTheir activity (or lack of) on the project\nTheir changing thinking of the space, which results in\nconflict with the overall direction of the project\nOther information that makes them unfit to be a maintainer,\nsuch as Code of Conduct issues, their activity outside the\nscope of the project that conflicts with the project\u2019s values\nConflicts of interest: filial or romantic relationships\nThe core maintainers then evaluate all information and make\na final decision to Confirm or Decline the removal. The decision\nof the core maintainers has to be articulated well and would be\npublic.\n\n## Nominating Core Maintainers#\n\nAny core or module maintainer can nominate someone to become a\ncore maintainer\nThe lead maintainer (BDFL) is responsible for evaluating the\nnomination.\nThe lead maintainer requests or puts together more information\naround the strength of the candidate to be a core maintainer:\nLetters of support from other core and module maintainers\nGeneral letters of support from stakeholders within the PyTorch\ncommunity\nAny new relevant information that is befitting for the candidacy\nThe lead maintainer evaluates all information and makes a final\ndecision to Confirm or Decline the nomination, with a clear public\narticulation of their reasoning behind the decision.\n\n## Removing the Lead Core Maintainer and Nominating a New Lead Core Maintainer#\n\nA super-majority of core maintainers (75%) can choose to\nremove the Lead Core Maintainer\nAfter a removal of the Lead Core Maintainer or in unforeseen\ncircumstances (such as permanent unavailability of the Lead Core\nMaintainer), the core maintainers follow a Ranked-Choice voting\nmethod to elect a new Lead Core Maintainer.\n\n## Add, Remove, and Re-Scope Modules and Projects#\n\nThe core maintainers together are responsible for taking\ndecisions on adding, removing and re-scoping new modules\nin the PyTorch org, either as new repositories in the\nPyTorch GitHub org, or as folders in thepytorch/pytorchrepository.\nThey invite proposals from members in the community\n(including themselves) for such changes.\nThe proposals are open-ended, but should have some basic\nground-work to make a convincing case to make change. The\nfollowing is an example approach to this process:\nInterview researchers / stakeholders, talk to community, gather issues;\nRead papers, attend conferences, build example pipelines based on experience;\nCreate a state of the world - make sure this change is necessary,\nfor example adding a new project or module is worth the maintenance\ncost; or removing a project or module will not remove too much value\nfrom PyTorch;\nCreate a proposal; the proposal covers the maintainership, development\nand community plan once the proposal is approved.\nThe core maintainers take final decisions on the proposal, articulating\nthe reasoning behind the decision publicly.\n\n## Decision Making#\n\n\n## Uncontroversial Changes#\n\nPrimary work happens through issues and pull requests on\nGitHub. Maintainers should avoid pushing their changes directly to\nthe PyTorch repository, instead relying on pull requests. Approving a\npull request by a core or module maintainer allows it to be merged\nwithout further process. Core and module maintainers, as listed on\ntheMaintainerspage and withinCODEOWNERSultimately approve these changes.\nNotifying relevant experts about an issue or a pull request\nis important. Reviews from experts in the given interest area are\nstrongly preferred, especially on pull request approvals. Failure to do\nso might end up with the change being reverted by the relevant expert.\n\n## Controversial Decision Process#\n\nSubstantial changes in a given interest area require a GitHub issue to\nbe opened for discussion. This includes:\nAny semantic or syntactic change to the PyTorch framework or library.\nBackwards-incompatible changes to the Python or C++ API.\nAdditions to the core framework or library, including substantial new\nfunctionality within an existing library.\nRemoval of core features or platform support\nCore and module maintainers ultimately approve these changes.\n\n## General Project Policies#\n\nPyTorch has been established as PyTorch a Series of LF Projects, LLC.\nPolicies applicable to PyTorch and participants in PyTorch, including\nguidelines on the usage of trademarks, are located athttps://www.lfprojects.org/policies/.\nPyTorch participants acknowledge that the copyright in all new contributions\nwill be retained by the copyright holder as independent works of authorship\nand that no contributor or copyright holder will be required to assign copyrights\nto the project. Except as described below, all code contributions to the project\nmust be made using the 3-Clause-BSD License available here:https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause(the \u201cProject License\u201d).\nAll outbound code will be made available under the Project License.\nThe Maintainers may approve the use of an alternative open license or\nlicenses for inbound or outbound contributions on an exception basis.\n\n## FAQ#\n\nQ: What if I would like to own (or partly own) a part of the project\nsuch as a feature area or domain library, for exampleLinear AlgebraorTorch Vision?This is absolutely possible.\nThe first step is to start contributing to the existing project area and\nsupporting its health and success. In addition to this, you can\nmake a proposal through a GitHub issue for new functionality or changes\nto improve the project area.\nQ: What if I am a company looking to use PyTorch internally for\ndevelopment, can I be granted or purchase a board seat to drive the\nproject direction?No, the PyTorch project is strictly driven by the\na maintainer project philosophy and clearly separates technical\ngovernance from business governance. However, if you want to be\ninvolved in sponsorship and support, you can become involved in the\nPyTorch Foundation (PTF) and sponsorship through this. You can also\nhave individual engineers look to become maintainers, but this is\nnot guaranteed and is merit-based.\nQ: Does the PyTorch project support grants or ways to support\nindependent developers using or contributing to the project?No, not\nat this point. We are however looking at ways to better support the\ncommunity of independent developers around PyTorch. If you have\nsuggestions or inputs, please reach out on the PyTorch forums to\ndiscuss.\nQ: How do I contribute code to the project?If the change is\nrelatively minor, a pull request on GitHub can be opened up immediately\nfor review and merge by the project committers. For larger changes,\nplease open an issue to make a proposal to discuss prior. Please also\nsee thePyTorch Contributor\nWikifor contribution\nfor a walkthrough.\nQ: Can I become a committer on the project?Unfortunately, the\ncurrent commit process to PyTorch involves an interaction with Facebook\ninfrastructure that can only be triggered by Facebook employees. We are\nhowever looking at ways to expand the committer base to individuals\noutside of Facebook and will provide an update when the tooling exists\nto allow this.\nQ: What if I would like to deliver a PyTorch tutorial at a conference\nor otherwise? Do I need to be \u2018officially\u2019 a committer to do this?No,\nwe encourage community members to showcase their work wherever and\nwhenever they can.
