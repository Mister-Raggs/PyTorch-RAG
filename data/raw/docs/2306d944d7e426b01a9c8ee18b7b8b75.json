Please refer to theContribution Guideon the PyTorch Wiki.\n\n## PyTorch Contribution Guide#\n\nCreated On: Mar 11, 2019 | Last Updated On: Apr 27, 2025\nPyTorch is a GPU-accelerated Python tensor computation package for\nbuilding deep neural networks using a tape-based autograd systems.\n\n## Contribution Process#\n\nThe PyTorch organization is governed byPyTorch\nGovernanceand the technical guide to contributing\ncan be found inCONTRIBUTING.md.\nThe PyTorch development process involves a healthy amount of open\ndiscussions between the core development team and the community.\nPyTorch operates similarly to most open source projects on GitHub.\nHowever, if you\u2019ve never contributed to an open source project before,\nhere is the basic process.\nFigure out what you\u2019re going to work on.The majority of open\nsource contributions come from people scratching their own itches.\nHowever, if you don\u2019t know what you want to work on, or are just\nlooking to get more acquainted with the project, here are some tips\nfor how to find appropriate tasks:\nLook through theissue\ntrackerand see if\nthere are any issues you know how to fix. Issues that are\nconfirmed by other contributors tend to be better to investigate.\nWe also maintain some labels for issues that are likely to be\ngood for new people, e.g.,bootcampand1hr, although\nthese labels are less well maintained.\nJoin us ondev discussand let us know you\u2019re interested in getting to\nknow PyTorch. We\u2019re very happy to help out researchers and\npartners get up to speed with the codebase.\nFigure out the scope of your change and reach out for design\ncomments on a GitHub issue if it\u2019s large.The majority of pull\nrequests are small; in that case, no need to let us know about what\nyou want to do, just get cracking. But if the change is going to be\nlarge, it\u2019s usually a good idea to get some design comments about it\nfirst bysubmitting an RFC.\nIf you don\u2019t know how big a change is going to be, we can help you\nfigure it out! Just post about it onissuesordev discuss.\nSome feature additions are very standardized; for example, lots of\npeople add new operators or optimizers to PyTorch. Design\ndiscussion in these cases boils down mostly to, \u201cDo we want this\noperator/optimizer?\u201d Giving evidence for its utility, e.g., usage\nin peer reviewed papers, or existence in other frameworks, helps a\nbit when making this case.\nAdding operators / algorithms from recently-released researchis generally not accepted unless there is overwhelming evidence that\nthis newly published work has ground-breaking results and will eventually\nbecome a standard in the field. If you are not sure where your method falls,\nopen an issue first before implementing a PR.\nCore changes and refactors can be quite difficult to coordinate\nsince the pace of development on the PyTorch main branch is quite fast.\nDefinitely reach out about fundamental or cross-cutting changes;\nwe can often give guidance about how to stage such changes into\nmore easily reviewable pieces.\nCode it out!\nSee theCONTRIBUTING.mdfile for advice for working with PyTorch in a\ntechnical form.\nOpen a pull request.\nIf you are not ready for the pull request to be reviewed, create a draft\npull request first - you can later convert it to a full PR by pressing\n\u201cReady for review\u201d button. You can also prepend the title of the PR with\n\u201c[WIP]\u201d (\u201cwork in progress\u201d) while it\u2019s still in draft. We will ignore\ndraft PRs when doing review passes. If you are working on a complex change,\nit\u2019s good to start things off as a draft, because you will need to spend\ntime looking at CI results to see if things worked out or not.\nFind an appropriate reviewer for your change. We have some folks\nwho regularly go through the PR queue and try to review\neverything, but if you happen to know who the maintainer for a\ngiven subsystem affected by your patch is, feel free to include\nthem directly on the pull request. You can learn more aboutPersons of Interestthat could review your code.\nIterate on the pull request until it\u2019s accepted!\nWe\u2019ll try our best to minimize the number of review round trips and\nblock PRs only when there are major issues. For the most common\nissues in pull requests, take a look atCommon Mistakes.\nOnce a pull request is accepted and CI is passing, there is\nnothing else you need to do; we will merge the PR for you.\n\n## Getting Started#\n\n\n## Proposing New Features#\n\nNew feature ideas are best discussed on a specific issue. Please include\nas much information as you can, any accompanying data, and your proposed\nsolution. The PyTorch team and community frequently review new issues\nand comments where they think they can help. If you feel confident in\nyour solution, go ahead and implement it.\n\n## Reporting Issues#\n\nIf you\u2019ve identified an issue, first search through thelist of\nexisting issueson the\nrepo. If you are unable to find a similar issue, then create a new one.\nSupply as much information you can to reproduce the problematic\nbehavior. Also, include any additional insights like the behavior you\nexpect.\n\n## Implementing Features or Fixing Bugs#\n\nIf you want to fix a specific issue, it\u2019s best to comment on the\nindividual issue with your intent. However, we do not lock or assign\nissues except in cases where we have worked with the developer before.\nIt\u2019s best to strike up a conversation on the issue and discuss your\nproposed solution. The PyTorch team can provide guidance that saves you\ntime.\nIssues that are labeled first-new-issue, low, or medium priority provide\nthe best entrance points and are great places to start.\n\n## Adding Tutorials#\n\nA great deal of the tutorials onpytorch.orgcome from the community itself and we welcome additional contributions.\nTo learn more about how to contribute a new tutorial you can learn more\nhere:PyTorch.org Tutorial Contribution Guide on\nGitHub\n\n## Improving Documentation & Tutorials#\n\nWe aim to produce high quality documentation and tutorials. On rare\noccasions that content includes typos or bugs. If you find something you\ncan fix, send us a pull request for consideration.\nTake a look at theDocumentationsection to learn how our system\nworks.\n\n## Participating in Online Discussions#\n\nYou can find active discussions happening on thePyTorch Discussion\nForumsfor users as well as thePyTorch Dev Discussion Forumsfor developers and maintainers.\n\n## Submitting Pull Requests to Fix Open Issues#\n\nYou can view a list of all open issueshere. Commenting on an\nissue is a great way to get the attention of the team. From here you can\nshare your ideas and how you plan to resolve the issue.\nFor more challenging issues, the team will provide feedback and\ndirection for how to best solve the issue.\nIf you\u2019re not able to fix the issue yourself, commenting and sharing\nwhether you can reproduce the issue can help the team\nidentify problem areas.\n\n## Reviewing Open Pull Requests#\n\nWe appreciate your help reviewing and commenting on pull requests. Our\nteam strives to keep the number of open pull requests at a manageable\nsize, we respond quickly for more information if we need it, and we\nmerge PRs that we think are useful. However, due to the high level of\ninterest, additional eyes on the pull requests are always appreciated.\n\n## Improving Code Readability#\n\nImproving code readability helps everyone. It is often better to submit a\nsmall number of pull requests that touch a few files versus a large pull\nrequest that touches many files. Starting a discussion in the PyTorch\nforumhereor on an issue related to\nyour improvement is the best way to get started.\n\n## Adding Test Cases to Make the Codebase More Robust#\n\nAdditional test coverage is appreciated.\n\n## Promoting PyTorch#\n\nYour use of PyTorch in your projects, research papers, write ups, blogs,\nor general discussions around the internet helps to raise awareness for\nPyTorch and our growing community. Please reach out tomarketing@pytorch.orgfor marketing support.\n\n## Triaging Issues#\n\nIf you feel that an issue could benefit from a particular tag or level\nof complexity, comment on the issue and share your opinion. If you\nfeel an issue isn\u2019t categorized properly, comment and let the team know.\n\n## About Open Source Development#\n\nIf this is your first time contributing to an open source project, some\naspects of the development process may seem unusual to you.\nThere is no way to \u201cclaim\u201d issues.People often want to \u201cclaim\u201d\nan issue when they decide to work on it, to ensure that there isn\u2019t\nwasted work when someone else ends up working on it. This doesn\u2019t\nreally work too well in open source, since someone may decide to work\non something, and end up not having time to do it. Feel free to give\ninformation in an advisory fashion, but at the end of the day, we\nwill take running code and rough consensus to move forward quickly.\nThere is a high bar for new functionality.Unlike\nin a corporate environment, where the person who wrote code\nimplicitly \u201cowns\u201d it and can be expected to take care of it for the\ncode\u2019s lifetime, once a pull request is merged into an open\nsource project, it immediately becomes the collective responsibility\nof all maintainers on the project. When we merge code, we are saying\nthat we, the maintainers, can review subsequent changes and\nmake a bugfix to the code. This naturally leads to a higher standard\nof contribution.\n\n## Common Mistakes To Avoid#\n\nDid you add tests?(Or if the change is hard to test, did you\ndescribe how you tested your change?)\nWe have a few motivations for why we ask for tests:\nto help us tell if we break it later\nto help us tell if the patch is correct in the first place\n(yes, we did review it, but as Knuth says, \u201cbeware of the\nfollowing code, for I have not run it, merely proven it\ncorrect\u201d)\nWhen is it OK not to add a test? Sometimes a change can\u2019t be\nconveniently tested, or the change is so obviously correct (and\nunlikely to be broken) that it\u2019s OK not to test it. On the\ncontrary, if a change seems likely (or is known to be likely)\nto be accidentally broken, it\u2019s important to put in the time to\nwork out a testing strategy.\nIs your PR too long?\nIt\u2019s easier for us to review and merge small PRs. The difficulty of\nreviewing a PR scales nonlinearly with its size.\nWhen is it OK to submit a large PR? It helps a lot if there was a\ncorresponding design discussion in an issue, with sign off from\nthe people who are going to review your diff. We can also help\ngive advice about how to split up a large change into individually\nshippable parts. Similarly, it helps if there is a complete\ndescription of the contents of the PR: it\u2019s easier to review code\nif we know what\u2019s inside!\nComments for subtle things?In cases where the behavior of your code\nis nuanced, please include extra comments and documentation to allow\nus to better understand the intention of your code.\nDid you add a hack?Sometimes, the right answer is a hack. But\nusually, we will have to discuss it.\nDo you want to touch a very core component?To prevent\nmajor regressions, pull requests that touch core components receive\nextra scrutiny. Make sure you\u2019ve discussed your changes with the team\nbefore undertaking major changes.\nWant to add a new feature?If you want to add new features,\ncomment your intention on the related issue. Our team tries to\ncomment on and provide feedback to the community. It\u2019s better to have\nan open discussion with the team and the rest of the community before\nbuilding new features. This helps us stay aware of what you\u2019re\nworking on and increases the chance that it\u2019ll be merged.\nDid you touch code unrelated to the PR?To aid in code review,\nplease only include files in your pull request that are directly\nrelated to your changes.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions#\n\nHow can I contribute as a reviewer?There is lots of value if\ncommunity developers reproduce issues, try out new functionality, or\notherwise help us identify or troubleshoot issues. Commenting on\ntasks or pull requests with your environment details is helpful and\nappreciated.\nCI tests failed, what does it mean?Maybe your PR is based\noff a broken main branch? You can try to rebase your change on top\nof the latest main branch. You can also see the current status of\nmain branch\u2019s CI athttps://hud.pytorch.org/.\nWhat are the most high risk changes?Anything that touches build\nconfiguration is a risky area. Please avoid changing these unless\nyou\u2019ve had a discussion with the team beforehand.\nHey, a commit showed up on my branch, what\u2019s up with that?Sometimes another community member will provide a patch or fix to\nyour pull request or branch. This is often needed for getting CI tests\nto pass.\n\n## On Documentation#\n\n\n## Python Docs#\n\nPyTorch documentation is generated from python source usingSphinx. Generated HTML is\ncopied to the docs folder in the main branch ofpytorch.org/docs,\nand is served via GitHub pages.\nSite:https://pytorch.org/docs\nGitHub:pytorch/pytorch\nServed from:https://pytorch.org/docs/main\n\n## C++ Docs#\n\nFor C++ code we use Doxygen to generate the content files. The C++ docs\nare built on a special server and the resulting files are copied to thepytorch/cppdocsrepo, and are served from GitHub\npages.\nSite:https://pytorch.org/cppdocs\nGitHub:pytorch/pytorch\nServed from:pytorch/cppdocs\n\n## Tutorials#\n\nPyTorch tutorials are documents used to help understand using PyTorch to\naccomplish specific tasks or to understand more holistic concepts.\nTutorials are built usingSphinx-Galleryfrom executable python source files, or from restructured-text (rst)\nfiles.\nSite:https://pytorch.org/tutorials\nGitHub:pytorch/tutorials\n\n## Tutorials Build Overview#\n\nFor tutorials,pull\nrequeststrigger a\nrebuild of the entire site using CircleCI to test the effects of the\nchange. This build is sharded into 9 worker builds and takes around 40\nminutes total. At the same time, we do a Netlify build usingmake\nhtml-noplot, which builds the site without rendering the notebook\noutput into pages for quick review.\nAfter a PR is accepted, the site is rebuilt and deployed using GitHub\nActions.\n\n## Contributing a New Tutorial#\n\nSeePyTorch.org Tutorial Contribution\nGuide.",
