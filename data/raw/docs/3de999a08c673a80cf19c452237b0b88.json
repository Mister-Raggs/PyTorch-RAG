AOT Inductor is part of the PT2 stack, similar to torch.compile, but it produces a compilation artifact that can work in a C++ environment. CUDA illegal memory errors can happen non-deterministically and even appear transient at times.\nOn a high-level, there are three main steps in debugging CUDA IMA errors:\nSanity checks: Use basic debugging flags to catch common issues before diving deeper.\nPinpoint the CUDA IMA: Make the error deterministic and identify the problematic kernel.\nIdentify problematic kernels: Use intermediate value debugging to inspect kernel inputs and outputs.\n\n## Step 1: Sanity Checks#\n\nBefore diving deep into reliably reproducing the error, try out some existing debugging flags:\n\n```python\nAOTI_RUNTIME_CHECK_INPUTS=1\nTORCHINDUCTOR_NAN_ASSERTS=1\n\n```\n\nThese flags take effect at compilation time (more precisely, at codegen time):\nAOTI_RUNTIME_CHECK_INPUTS=1checks if the inputs satisfy the same set of guards used during compilation. Seetorch.compile Troubleshootingfor more details.\nAOTI_RUNTIME_CHECK_INPUTS=1\nTORCHINDUCTOR_NAN_ASSERTS=1adds codegen before and after each Inductor\u2019s kernel to check for NaN.\nTORCHINDUCTOR_NAN_ASSERTS=1\n\n## Step 2: Pinpoint the CUDA IMA#\n\nOne hard part is CUDA IMA errors can be non-deterministic. They can happen at different locations, and sometimes not happen at all (though that just means the numerics are silently incorrect). With the following two flags, we can trigger the error deterministically:\n\n```python\nPYTORCH_NO_CUDA_MEMORY_CACHING=1\nCUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1\n\n```\n\nThese flags take effect at runtime:\nPYTORCH_NO_CUDA_MEMORY_CACHING=1disables PyTorch\u2019s Caching Allocator, which allocates a bigger buffer than needed immediately to reduce the number of buffer allocations. This is usually the reason why CUDA illegal memory access errors are non-deterministic.Figure: How PyTorch\u2019s caching allocator can mask CUDA illegal memory access errors\nPYTORCH_NO_CUDA_MEMORY_CACHING=1\nCUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1forces the kernels to launch one at a time. Without this, we would get the famous \u201cCUDA kernel errors might be asynchronously reported at some other API call\u201d warning since kernels are launched asynchronously.\nCUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1\n\n## Step 3: Identify Problematic Kernels with Intermediate Value Debugger#\n\nThe AOTI Intermediate Value Debugger can help pinpoint the problematic kernel and get information about the inputs and outputs of said kernel.\nFirst, use:\n\n```python\nAOT_INDUCTOR_DEBUG_INTERMEDIATE_VALUE_PRINTER=3\n\n```\n\nThis flag takes effect at compilation time and prints the kernels one by one at runtime. Together with the previous flags, this would let us know which kernel was launched right before the error happened.\nHowever, it is important to note that just because the error happened in that kernel, it doesn\u2019t mean that kernel is problematic. For example, it can happen that an earlier kernel is problematic and produces some wrong outputs. So the natural next step is to inspect the inputs to the problematic kernel:\n\n```python\nAOT_INDUCTOR_FILTERED_KERNELS_TO_PRINT=\"triton_poi_fused_add_ge_logical_and_logical_or_lt_231,_add_position_embeddings_kernel_5\" AOT_INDUCTOR_DEBUG_INTERMEDIATE_VALUE_PRINTER=2\n\n```\n\nThe filtered kernels to print environment variable has the names of the kernels you want to inspect. If the inputs to the kernel are not as expected, you then inspect the kernel that produces the bad input.\n\n## Additional Debugging Tools#\n\n\n## Logging and Tracing#\n\ntlparse / TORCH_TRACE: Provides complete output codes for inspection and records the set of guards used. Seetlparse / TORCH_TRACEfor more details.\nTORCH_LOGS: UseTORCH_LOGS=\"+inductor,output_code\"to see more PT2 internal logs. SeeTORCH_LOGSfor more details.\nTORCH_LOGS=\"+inductor,output_code\"\nTORCH_SHOW_CPP_STACKTRACES: SetTORCH_SHOW_CPP_STACKTRACES=1to potentially see more stack traces.\nTORCH_SHOW_CPP_STACKTRACES=1\n\n## Common Sources of Issues#\n\nDynamic shapes: Historically a source of many IMAs. Pay special attention when debugging dynamic shape scenarios.\nCustom ops: Especially when implemented in C++ and used with dynamic shapes. There is a need to Symint\u2019ify the meta function.",
