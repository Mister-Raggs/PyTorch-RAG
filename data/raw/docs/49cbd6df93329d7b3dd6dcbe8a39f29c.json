Normally, it is the highest-level function that doesn\u2019t result in excessive graph breaks.\nFunctions that do a lot of preprocessing or I/O operations are examples of functions that result in many graph breaks and do not significantly benefit fromtorch.compile.\na. You can isolate issues by first compiling individual functions/modules before compiling entire models.\ntorch.compile\ntorch.compile\nApplytorch.compiler.disableto functions in the compiled region that result in a lot of graph breaks\nand do not benefit from compilation. In this case, one graph break is better than potentially tens or hundreds.\ntorch.compiler.disable\nUseTORCH_LOGS=\"graph_breaks\"or tlparse to investigate remaining graph breaks.Work around these graph breaks using the same approaches as working around graph breaks under\nthefullgraph=Trueprogramming model. Not all graph breaks need to be removed - some may\nimpact performance more than others. The general rule is to focus on graph breaks that are happening during model computation.\na. We recommend usingtorch.compile(backend='eager')when debugging graph breaks, for faster debugging iteration times\nTORCH_LOGS=\"graph_breaks\"\nfullgraph=True\ntorch.compile(backend='eager')\ncompile(model)\nmodel.compile()\nerror_on_graph_break\nerror_on_graph_break(False)\nerror_on_graph_break(True)\nerror_on_graph_break\nfullgraph\nfullgraph=True/False\nerror_on_graph_break",
