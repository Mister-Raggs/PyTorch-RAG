Negative inputs are remapped to positive values with the formula0xffff_ffff_ffff_ffff + seed.\nGenerator\n\nSets the seed for generating random numbers to a non-deterministic\nrandom number on all devices. Returns a 64 bit number used to seed the RNG.\nint\nSets the random number generator state.\nNote\nThis function only works for CPU.
