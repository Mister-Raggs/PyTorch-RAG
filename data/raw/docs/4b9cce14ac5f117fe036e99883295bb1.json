  "text": "\n## PyTorch Main Components#\n\nCreated On: Aug 13, 2025 | Last Updated On: Aug 13, 2025\nPyTorch is a flexible and powerful library for deep learning that provides a comprehensive set of tools for building, training, and deploying machine learning models.\n\n## PyTorch Components for Basic Deep Learning#\n\nSome of the basic PyTorch components include:\nTensors- N-dimensional arrays that serve as PyTorch\u2019s fundamental\ndata structure. They support automatic differentiation, hardware acceleration, and provide a comprehensive API for mathematical operations.\nAutograd- PyTorch\u2019s automatic differentiation engine\nthat tracks operations performed on tensors and builds a computational\ngraph dynamically to be able to compute gradients.\nNeural Network API- A modular framework for building neural networks with pre-defined layers,\nactivation functions, and loss functions. Thenn.Modulebase class provides a clean interface\nfor creating custom network architectures with parameter management.\nnn.Module\nDataLoaders- Tools for efficient data handling that provide\nfeatures like batching, shuffling, and parallel data loading. They abstract away the complexities\nof data preprocessing and iteration, allowing for optimized training loops.\n\n## PyTorch Compiler#\n\nThe PyTorch compiler is a suite of tools that optimize model execution and\nreduce resource requirements. You can learn more about the PyTorch compilerhere.",
