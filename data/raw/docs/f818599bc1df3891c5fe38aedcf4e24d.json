Dynamo is a Python bytecode interpreter and generally does not know how to handle calls to C/C++/CUDA functions that are bound to Python.\nDynamo and non-strict tracing have trouble tracing through a function and you want it to be ignored bytorch.compile.\ntorch.compile\nPlease seethe Python custom ops tutorialfor more details on how to wrap a Python function into atorch.compile-understood custom operator.\ntorch.compile\nFor more advanced use cases, you may wish to use our C++ Custom Operator API; please seeherefor more information.",
